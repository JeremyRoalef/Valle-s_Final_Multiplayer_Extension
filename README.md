<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
  This repository will store a racing car game. This repository was forked from <a href = 'https://github.com/Valle94/FinalProject'>Valle's Repo</a>, where he made a singleplayer racing game with procedurally-generated levels. This repository aims to expand on Valle's project to include multiplayer. Additionally, this repo will aim to expand the core gameplay of the base game for a complete experience.

<h1>The Base Project</h1>
<p>
  Below, you may find screenshots showing what the project is starting from. The project has a fully-working car, a win condition, and a procedurally-generated level system. This is everything that will be needed to start working on a multiplayer game.
